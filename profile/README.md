# Welcome to SkywardAI 🚀

SkywardAI is an open-source community dedicated to advancing the field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. It is created by a group of passionate students from the RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. Our goal is to provide the free, real open-source artificial intelligence solutions that enable anyone to democratize and run language models on consumer-grade hardware. And also support cloud-native deployment. The community is inspired by an open-source OpenAI alternative API  [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI).


# 🌟 What We Do

We are decicated to providing an open-source ecosystem that empowers you build, customize, and deploy your lagnaueg model as solution for your specific needs. Below is our scope:

# 👩‍🌾 Our Mission

**Our mission is to make modern AI techniques accessible and beneficial for everyone.**

We will delivery:

* Smoothly streaming inference on CPUs with the open-sourced multimodal models which under 10B parameters
* Doing inference with RAG mode
* Define neural networks based on Transformer architecture
* Simple trainer for customize neural nets training
* Visualization the structure of neural nets and the training process
* Deployment by only one command


# 🚀 Our Vision

**Our vision is to create a thriving community of developers and enthusiasts who are passionate about AI technology.**

* Everyone can be a neural network hero, today we define funcs, tomorrow we define neural nets
* AI isn't a bubble it can be a runable solution at the consumer-grade hardware
