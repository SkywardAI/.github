Welcome to Skyward.AI, an ambitious initiative spearheaded by the AI enthusiasts from RMIT. Our mission is to leverage advanced AI techniques to revolutionize the way we approach programming, making this domain more accessible, efficient, and integrated with cutting-edge AI capabilities.


## 🌟 What We Do

At SkywardAI, we believe in pushing the boundaries of technology and developing cutting-edge solutions. Here's what we're currently working on:

- Create a dynamic ecosystem that fosters innovation in AI, specifically tailored for the automation of interactive services.
- Building RAG frameworks empower LLMs for specific tasks
- Visualzation the data that empowers the user to understand the data and make better decisions.


## 🚀 Our Vision

Large Language Model as a Service (LaaS) is our flagship project, which aims to provide a comprehensive AI-based solution for automatic tools. We're building a platform that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize the way we approach programming.
