Welcome to Skyward.AI, an ambitious initiative spearheaded by the AI enthusiasts of the go-Skynet community, inspired by Mulder's vision. Our mission is to leverage advanced AI techniques to revolutionize the way we approach programming algorithms, making this domain more accessible, efficient, and integrated with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

## üåü What We Do

At SkywardAI, we believe in pushing the boundaries of technology and developing cutting-edge solutions. Here's what we're currently working on:

- Create a dynamic ecosystem that fosters innovation in AI, specifically tailored for the programming algorithm domain. 
- Our project is not just about building tools; it's about creating a gateway to exploring the vast potential of AI in programming, contributing to the go-Skynet community, and sharing our discoveries with the world.


## üöå Our Roadmap

1. Model Selection: Identify and acquire a basic, yet specific, AI model focused on the programming algorithm domain. This model will serve as the cornerstone of our project, guiding our efforts in generating insightful technology articles and documentation for our community.
2. Scaling Solutions: Address computational and storage limitations by implementing efficient scaling strategies. Techniques such as transformers, PEFT, and LoRA will be explored to enhance our model's capabilities without overburdening resources.
3. Collaborative Tools: Utilize existing tools and frameworks to augment our development process, ensuring that we remain focused on our core objective of advancing programming algorithms through AI.
4. Focused Innovation: Develop a bespoke version of an AI assistant, tailored exclusively for programming algorithms. This tool will be designed to integrate seamlessly with development environments like VSCode, providing our team and the community with an intuitive interface for accessing our AI-powered insights.
5. LLVM Enhancement: Apply our AI techniques to make LLVMs more aligned with our vision, ensuring that our contributions are not only innovative but also practical and applicable to real-world programming challenges.
6. Community Contributions: Engage with the broader IT and open-source communities by participating in events like Hacktoberfest. This will not only showcase our project but also allow us to contribute to and learn from the global developer ecosystem.
7. GNU Hurd Efforts: Extend our project's impact by contributing to the GNU Hurd, demonstrating our commitment to supporting and advancing open-source software.
