# Welcome to SkywardAI 🚀

SkywardAI, an open-source community founded by [Bowen](https://github.com/Aisuko) during his postgraduate studies at RMIT, focuses on developing efficient and specialized AI models. The mission targets creating high-performing AI solutions that prioritize accessibility, efficiency, and sustainability, empowering users to run advanced AI models on consumer-grade hardware while supporting cloud-native deployment.

**The community is inspired by an open-source OpenAI alternative API  [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI).**


# 🌟 What We Do

Our AI open-source community aims to develop specialized, high-performing models that are not only smaller but also optimized for specific tasks. Unlike massive LLMs, these models prioritize efficiency and accessibility while maintaining top-tier performance. By minimizing data requirements and reducing computational demands, we can create a more sustainable AI ecosystem—maximizing intelligence per watt. This approach ensures that AI remains both powerful and practical, making advanced technology more accessible for widespread adoption.
