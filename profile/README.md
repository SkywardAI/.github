# Welcome to SkywardAI üöÄ

SkywardAI is an open-source community dedicated to advancing the field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. It is created by a group of passionate students from the RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. Our goal is to provide the free, real open-source RAG framework and data analysis tools which run on the consumer-grade hardware, also support cloud-native deployment. The community is inspired by an open-source OpenAI alternative API [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI).


# üåü What We Do
