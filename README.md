# SkywardAI — Org Meta & Platform Overview

Agentic AI + HA k3s GPU edge + secure mesh for private, distributional intelligence.

## What This Repo Is
- `.github/` org configuration, profile README, and shared community docs for the SkywardAI org.
- Quick snapshot of the SkywardAI platform pillars and tools.
- Landing page demo lives in `docs/index.html` (for GitHub Pages or local viewing).

## Platform Pillars
- **Agentic AI**: chatbots and orchestration that stay model-agnostic.
- **Edge Compute**: HA k3s control plane with GPU-aware scheduling.
- **Secure Mesh**: zero-config connectivity across clusters and devices.
- **Observability & Console**: health, GPU telemetry, and analytics in one view.

## Key Tools
- **Chatbot incubator** for private knowledge bases.
- **Citation tool** for grounded, source-linked answers.
- **Anonymous checker** for de-identification and compliance.
- **Conference checker** for formatting and plagiarism gates.
- **Pipelines** for ingest → RAG → eval.

## Edge Principles
- Distributional clusters with self-healing workloads.
- Minimal agentic primitives tuned for edge performance.
- Data sovereignty: models and embeddings stay on your infra.
