# SkywardAI — Repository meta and community

This folder contains community and repository-maintenance information for SkywardAI.

**Themed demo / landing page:** A Tailwind-powered landing page demo is available at `docs/index.html` in this repository. It uses the Tailwind CDN and a Dark/Light toggle; serve it locally with:

```
python -m http.server --directory docs 8000
```

Or enable GitHub Pages with the `docs/` folder to host the full demo publicly.

> Note: GitHub's README renderer sanitizes scripts and styles, so the full Tailwind-powered demo should be viewed as a static HTML page (local or via Pages).
